a.Problem Statement:

The objective of this project is to implement and evaluate six different machine learning classification models to predict student passing status(Pass/ Fail). Using the UCI student Performance Dataset, the goal is to identify whether a studen will pass ( Grade >=10) or fail based on various demographic, social and academic features. The project involves building an end- to-end ML workflow, from model training and metric evaluation to deployment on Streamlit.

b. Dataset Description 
. Source: UCI Machine leanring repostitory - Student Performance(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).
. Target Variable: Pass_status (Binary : 1 for pass , 0 for fail)
. Mininum feature size - 30 which meets requirement greater than 12
. Minimun instant size - 649 (> 500 satisfies the requirement)
. Features included - Student age, parental educationm weekly study timem failures, alcohol consumptionm and health status.
